The level that I created is a 3rd person game that requires the player to pick up a key and then reach the exit. I created a basic level that has 2 main rooms and a path between them. On the path the player can see the key pickup. Once the key is grabbed the exit door is opened and the player can reach the exit pad.

My main source I used was the unity manual to clear a few things up (linked below)

I also used the movement script that we created for our game
